## Review over FIT1047
The unit has more memorization than actual understanding, partly because the whole unit itself comprised of three different domains - computer systems, computer networks and computer security. Not much interesting stuffs to feed the brain, most of content only serves the basic stuffs. Will recommend to do self-study if want to explore deeper, as lectures tend to be a little boring.

Overall Review: 5/10<br>Final Grade: HD
