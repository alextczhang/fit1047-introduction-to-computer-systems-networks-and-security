1. Bit rate, bandwidth
- Bit rate is the number of bits that can be transmitted in one unit of time
- example of 7Mbps, number of bits transmitted is 7 million bits every second, bit rate is the 7 million bits per second 
- Bandwidth is the maximum amount of bit rate that can be produced
- bandwidth is a range of frequencies to be transmitted during the process
- Amount of frequency that is used during the transfer rate
- How much frequency that I have to transmit data
- higher frequency transmit more data in a faster way


2. Latency
- a measurement of how long it takes to transmit a particular data from one source to its destination
- higher latency means it takes longer time for loading/downloading/transmitting data
- lower latency means it takes shorter time to load / transmit data
- amount of time taken to transmit a message from a sender to receiver


3. Network layers, PDU, encapsulation
- Network layers represent a routing where it determines which path a packet should go in order to transmit a data from one source to its destination, usually they transmit through intermediate routers 
- PDU 
- encapsulation is the process of taking data from one protocol and translating it into another protocol, so the data can continue across a network. more of like covering an envelope with another envelope. 
 - Encapsulation happens at all layers. Encapsulating the dat so that it can be used by the protocol. Generally most machines use ipv4.`
